# Stresslog

A package to calculate and plot pore pressure and other geomechanical data from las files. It is intended for pre-drill and post-drill studies of wells, and can be used for limited realtime stress prediction.

## Features

* Import las files, dlis files, deviation files, ucs and lithology files

* Alias logs using user modifiable alias file

* Pad log data all the way to surface, using appropriate KB, GL or WD values (Option to specify these and correct these in the Log Header)

* Calculate geomechanical properties using 6 component stress tensor 

* Calculate Pore Pressure, Shmin, SHMax, Sv and UCS and more

* Plot Stress Polygon, Wellbore Stability and more at drainhole analysis depth

* Plot the data in user configurable intervals

* Option to save Plots at custom DPI

* Export the well data as .csv, so you can run your own plots and calculations in your software of choice

* Output Las Files (with updated header and new data columns)

* Parameters for adding mud data, loss/gain data and other data interpreted from drilling and testing history, these are plotted over the calculated data to help visually constrain the model

* Option to include ascii file with observations from resistivity image logs (or others like ultrasonic calipers) to include tensile fractures and breakouts, which are then used internally to better constrain SHMax

* Override nu, mu, and UCS and tensile strength from the lithology file

Jon Jincai Zhang, for his awesome work on pore pressure prediction, and geomechanics at large. This software uses his algorithms wherever possible.

The Stability Analysis Plots are after [Peska and Zoback, 1995](https://doi.org/10.1029/95JB00319). The Stress Polygon Technique for constraining SHMax is after [Zoback et al., 2003](https://doi.org/10.1029/95JB00319) The Pore Pressure equation is from [Zhang, 2011](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.earscirev.2011.06.001) The shmin is calculated in accordance with [Dianes, 1982](https://doi.org/10.2118/9254-PA), as well as [Zoback and Healy,1992](https://doi.org/10.1029/91JB02175)

This software is written in Python, using the python library Welly by Agile Scientific, Canada. Welly itself uses the Lasio library to handle the las files. Dlis files are handled using dlisio package by Equinor. Other libraries used include Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Plotly and Scipy.
